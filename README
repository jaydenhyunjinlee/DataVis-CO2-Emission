CO2 Emission.ipynb contains analysis and transformations
I made on co2_emission.csv dataset from Kaggle community

Contents include data visualizations, data integration, and such

Main goal of this project is to demonstrate my understandings on
how to integrate and aggregate data for analysis

Some of the main toolkits that were employed in this notebook includes
Python Pandas, Python Numpy, and Matplotlib Pyplot software libraries.

First bar graph displays change in average global CO2 emission rate over
~200 year interval

Second line graph shows trend of CO2 emission rates in the five most developed countries in the world

Third pie chart is divided upon the amount of CO2 emitted across the globe

Last pie chart is to show how much USA and China alone contributed to global CO2 emission rate in 2017
